  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement 3D interactive button enhancements
  - Create enhanced button component with neomorphic styling for "Rent Now" button
  - Implement hover state with 3D transform effects (translateY, scale, shadow depth)
  - Add active state with inset shadow effect simulating button press
  - Implement accessible focus states with neomorphic design principles
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Add 3D typography effects to hero content
  - Enhance main heading with subtle text shadow for depth perception
  - Implement gradient text effects for visual interest while maintaining readability
  - Add smooth entrance animations with 3D transforms for text elements
  - Ensure typography remains accessible and readable across all devices
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 4.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Create floating element system for visual hierarchy
  - Design and implement decorative geometric shapes with 3D positioning
  - Add subtle floating animations using CSS transforms
  - Create layered content containers with depth effects
  - Implement hover interactions for floating elements
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Implement responsive design optimizations
  - Adapt neomorphic effects for mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions
  - Scale 3D effects appropriately for tablet viewports
  - Optimize desktop experience to showcase full range of enhancements
  - Test and adjust performance across different device capabilities
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Add accessibility and performance safeguards
  - Implement reduced motion preferences to disable 3D effects when requested
  - Create high contrast mode alternatives for accessibility tools
  - Add browser compatibility fallbacks for older browsers
  - Implement hardware acceleration optimizations for smooth animations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 8. Create smooth entrance animations for hero section
  - Implement staggered reveal animations for hero content elements
  - Add 3D transform entrance effects (translateY, scale, rotateX)
  - Ensure animations respect user motion preferences
  - Optimize animation performance to maintain 60fps frame rate
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.3, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Integrate with existing scroll reveal system
  - Extend current scroll-reveal.js functionality to support 3D transforms
  - Add neomorphic styling to existing reveal classes
  - Ensure new animations work seamlessly with existing page scroll effects
  - Test integration with other page sections that use scroll reveals
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Performance testing and optimization
  - Implement CSS containment for animation layers to improve performance
  - Add will-change properties for elements with 3D transforms
  - Test frame rate performance during animations and interactions
  - Optimize CSS selectors to minimize reflow and repaint operations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
