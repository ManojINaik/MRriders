# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing scroll reveal animation system on the Scoot website by implementing the JavaScript functionality to trigger smooth, professional animations as elements come into view during scrolling. The current CSS animations are already defined but lack the intersection observer logic to activate them when elements enter the viewport.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see smooth animations when scrolling through the page, so that the browsing experience feels more engaging and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls down the page THEN elements SHALL animate into view with smooth transitions
2. WHEN an element enters the viewport THEN it SHALL trigger its reveal animation automatically
3. WHEN a user has reduced motion preferences enabled THEN animations SHALL be disabled or minimized
4. WHEN elements are already in view on page load THEN they SHALL animate in immediately without waiting for scroll

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want animations to feel natural and not overwhelming, so that the content remains accessible and pleasant to consume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple elements animate simultaneously THEN they SHALL have staggered timing to avoid visual chaos
2. WHEN animations trigger THEN they SHALL use smooth easing functions for professional appearance
3. WHEN elements animate THEN the animation duration SHALL be optimized for performance and user experience
4. WHEN animations complete THEN elements SHALL remain in their final state without reverting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor using assistive technology, I want animations to respect accessibility preferences, so that the site remains usable regardless of my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has "prefers-reduced-motion" enabled THEN all scroll animations SHALL be disabled
2. WHEN animations are disabled THEN content SHALL still be fully visible and accessible
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN animations SHALL not interfere with focus management
4. WHEN screen readers are active THEN animations SHALL not disrupt content reading flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor on various devices, I want animations to work smoothly across different screen sizes and performance capabilities, so that the experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN animations SHALL perform smoothly without lag
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN animation triggers SHALL adjust appropriately
3. WHEN the device has limited performance THEN animations SHALL degrade gracefully
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN animations SHALL not block content loading

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want different types of content to have appropriate animation styles, so that the visual hierarchy and content flow feel intentional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN section headers appear THEN they SHALL use fade-up animations
2. WHEN card grids appear THEN individual cards SHALL animate with staggered timing
3. WHEN testimonials appear THEN they SHALL use subtle scale animations
4. WHEN form elements appear THEN they SHALL use gentle slide animations from appropriate directions
