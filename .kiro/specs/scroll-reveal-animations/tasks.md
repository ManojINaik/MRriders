# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core ScrollRevealManager class structure


  - Implement basic class constructor with configuration options
  - Add methods for initialization, setup, and cleanup
  - Create element detection and storage mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Implement Intersection Observer integration


  - Set up Intersection Observer with optimal configuration
  - Create intersection callback handler for element visibility detection
  - Add threshold and root margin configuration for precise triggering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Add accessibility and reduced motion support









  - Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query detection
  - Create fallback behavior for when animations are disabled
  - Add graceful degradation for browsers without Intersection Observer support
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Create element classification and animation triggering system









  - Implement automatic detection of existing reveal classes in HTML
  - Add logic to apply 'revealed' class when elements enter viewport
  - Create staggered animation system for elements with reveal-stagger class
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement performance optimizations and error handling
  - Add element unobserving after animation completion to free memory
  - Create error handling for failed animations with fallback to immediate reveal
  - Implement batching for multiple simultaneous intersections
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Add initialization script and integrate with existing HTML
  - Create initialization code that runs on DOM content loaded
  - Add the scroll reveal script to the existing HTML file
  - Test integration with existing CSS animation classes
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for ScrollRevealManager class methods
  - Create integration tests for full scroll scenarios
  - Add accessibility tests for reduced motion and screen reader compatibility
  - Write performance tests for multiple elements and rapid scrolling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Add final polish and browser compatibility
  - Test across different browsers and devices
  - Add polyfill support for older browsers if needed
  - Optimize animation timing and easing for professional feel
  - Ensure mobile performance is smooth and responsive
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
